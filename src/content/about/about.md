Hi! My name is Aadhish Sriram, but you can also call me by nickname, dfireBird.
I'm a Software developer from India. I'm currently interning in [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/consulting) and
pursuing my Bachelor Engineering degree on Computer Science in SASTRA Deemed University.
I love working on projects and learn more things.

I'm an aspiriing open-source enthusiast and my projects are often open-sourced.
I watch anime or english TV shows and read manga when I'm not programming or studying.

This site is meant as way both to showcase my work and a blog where can I share
about my experience and journey into programming, so the name "A Programmer's
Journey".

## Programming

Rust is my go-to choice of programming language now and at-times I
like to use Haskell, Elixir and Typescript.

I'm working on to finish Papercups, a peer-to-peer chat application in Rust
and to make it more sensible to use.

I also have some experience in Javascript, Racket, C++, Python, C and Java
as well as HTML and CSS.

## Technologies

I often work with Emacs as my editor to program and Linux (I use Arch btw) is 
the OS of my choice.

I also have experience in following technologies:

* Git

* React

* Gatsby

* REST API

* GraphQL

* Docker

* AWS

I also had my share with databases such as Postgres and MonogoDB.

## Projects

Some of my notable projects are:

1. **Personal Website** - This website you're currently in, built using Gatsby used as portfolio and blog.
2. **Emourge** - Discord bot which records emojis sent by the user in a server
and give statistics about them.
3. **Papercups** - P2P chat and file application
4. **Programmer News Bot** - Telegram bot which retrieve and send posts from
Hacker News.
