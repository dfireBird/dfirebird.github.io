Hi! My name is Aadhish Sriram, but you can also call me by nickname, dfireBird.
I'm an Software developer from India. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor
Engineering degree on Computer Science in SASTRA Deemed to-be University.
I'm an active learner and love working on projects.

I'm an open-source enthusiast and try to use open-source applications as much as
possible and my projects are often open-sourced. I watch anime or TV shows and
read manga when I'm not programming or studying.

This site is meant as way both to showcase my work and a blog where can I share
about my experience and journey into programming, so the name "A Programmer's
Journey".

## Programming

Rust is my go-to choice of programming language now and at-times I
like to use Haskell, Elixir and Typescript.

I'm working on to finish Tincan, a peer-to-peer chat application in Rust
and to make it more sensible to use and at-times I work on jkbbwr's Forge.

I also have some experience in Javascript, Racket, C++, Python, C and Java
as well as HTML and CSS.

## Technologies

I often work with Emacs as my editor to program and Linux (I use Arch btw) is 
the OS of my choice.

I have experience in following technologies:

* Git

* React

* Gatsby

* REST API

* GraphQL

* Docker

* AWS

I also had my share with databases such as Postgres and MonogoDB.

## Projects

Some of my notable projects are:

1. **Personal Website** - Website built using Gatsby used as portfolio and blog.
2. **Emourge** - Discord bot which records emojis sent by the user in a server
and give statistics about them.
2. **Programmer News Bot** - Telegram bot which retrieve and send posts from
Hacker News.
3. **scarpddit** - A CLI which retrieves post from reddit when invoked
