Hi! My name is Aadhish Sriram, but you can also call me by nickname, dfireBird.
I'm an Software developer from India. I'm currently studying my Engineering 
course on Computer Science in SASTRA Deemed to-be University. I'm an active 
learner and love working on programming projects.

I'm an open-source enthusiast and try to use open-source applications as much as
possible and my projects are often open-sourced. I watch anime or TV shows and
read manga when I'm not programming.

This site is meant as way both to showcase my work and a blog where can I share
about my experience and journey into programming, so the name "A Programmer's
Journey".

## Programming

My key programming languages are Javascript and Rust

I recently started learning Rust and working on implementation of Bittorent
Protocol in Rust.

I also have some experience in Typescript, Python, C++, C and Java.

## Technologies

I often work with Emacs as my editor to program and Linux (I use Arch btw) is 
the OS of my choice.

I have experience in following technologies:

* Git

* React

* Gatsby

* REST API

* GraphQL

* Docker

* AWS

I also had my share with databases such as MySQL and MonogoDB.

## Projects

Some of my notable projects are:

1. **birdtorrent_rs** - Bittorent protocol implementation in Rust.
2. **Personal Website** - Website built using Gatsby used as portfolio and blog.
3. **Programmer News Bot** - Telegram bot which retrieve and send posts from 
Hacker News.
4. **scarpddit** - A CLI which retrieves post from reddit when invoked
